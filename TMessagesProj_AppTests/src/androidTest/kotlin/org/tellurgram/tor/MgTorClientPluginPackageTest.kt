/**
 * Locks down MgTorClient.pluginPackage() — the resolver for the Tor plugin
 * package. It must yield the single unsuffixed release plugin: every main
 * flavor (.beta debug, .web standalone, stable, F-Droid) is signed with the
 * same release.keystore as the release plugin, so all bind one package and no
 * suffixed plugin variant is ever built or published. A per-flavor suffix here
 * once pointed at a `...plugin.tor.beta` package nothing installs, which fired
 * the install prompt forever (the `.beta`-main reinstall loop).
 *
 * Reflection is used because pluginPackage is private static; exposing it to a
 * wider scope just for tests would pollute the public API.
