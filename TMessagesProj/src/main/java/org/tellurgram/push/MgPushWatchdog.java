/**
 * Periodic wake-up that puts push back on its feet without the user having to open the app.
 * Nothing else does that: when the distributor drops the subscription, or the keep-alive
 * service is killed, or the endpoint simply stops being delivered to, the app stays offline
 * until it is opened by hand - which is the shape of every "notifications stopped arriving for
 * a day" report.
 *
 * The alarm is inexact on purpose: an exact one needs SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM, and re-registering
 * at a precise minute is worth nothing. The price is that in Doze the alarm is deferred to the
 * next maintenance window, so the real spacing can be much longer than the interval asked for.
