/**
 * UnifiedPush distributor that delivers through Firebase Cloud Messaging without any
 * Google library: the upstream receiver only talks to Play Services over IPC, and Play
 * Services answers with a plain WebPush endpoint.
 *
 * FCM accepts pushes to that endpoint only with a VAPID authorization, which Telegram
 * does not send, so the endpoint handed to Telegram is the aesgcm-proxy gateway's /fcm
 * route: it folds the aesgcm headers into the body, signs with the private half of the
 * configured VAPID key and forwards to FCM. From
 * {@link org.telegram.messenger.UnifiedPushReceiver} on, the payload is handled exactly
 * like any other distributor's.
 *
 * The route and the VAPID public key are one gateway identity and only work as a pair:
 * a host that does not hold the matching private half signs with a key FCM does not
 * know, and every push is rejected. So both follow the same UnifiedPush gateway setting
 * - the route is derived from it, and the key sits next to it in the settings - instead
 * of being pinned to the Mercurygram gateway, which used to lock self-hosters out.
