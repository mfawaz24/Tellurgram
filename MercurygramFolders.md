# Mercurygram folders

Telegram caps chat folders server-side (10 for free accounts, 20 with Premium,
100 / 200 chats per folder). Folder membership, however, is computed entirely
on the client: the server only stores the folder definition. Mercurygram
therefore supports **Mercurygram folders**: ordinary folders whose definition
never reaches Telegram's folder API, so they count against no limit. Turn one on
with the "Mercurygram folder" switch when creating a folder; once the server
limit is hit, "Create new folder" goes straight to one. The same switch on an
existing folder moves it: to Mercurygram (the server definition is deleted, the
folder joins the document below) or to Telegram (created there, the folder
leaves the document). A move assigns a new id, so ids are stable only while a
folder stays out of Telegram.

Mercurygram folders are kept in step across devices through a single JSON
document in **Saved Messages**, edited in place. Telegram already knows every
folder definition on the account, so this leaks nothing new, and no third-party
service is involved. This file is the wire format, shared with the Desktop
client and with bots that resolve folders (for example ubot).

## The message

One document message in Saved Messages (`peer = inputPeerSelf`):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `document.file_name` | `tellurgram-folders.json` |
| `document.mime_type` | `application/json` |
| caption | first line `#tellurgram_folders`, then optional human-readable lines `📁 <title> (<n> chats)`; at most 1024 characters, truncated at a line boundary |

**Discovery**: `messages.search(peer=inputPeerSelf, q="#tellurgram_folders",
filter=inputMessagesFilterDocument, limit=5)`, then keep the messages whose
document `file_name` matches and take the one with the highest id.

**Writing**: writers edit that message in place (`messages.editMessage` with a
new `inputMediaUploadedDocument` and the caption above; a user's own Saved
Messages have no edit time limit). When no message exists yet, send a new one.
Readers cache the message id and re-search on a miss. A client that sees the
message deleted re-searches as well, and posts a fresh document when the search
confirms it is gone, so a deletion from Saved Messages costs nothing. If two
devices created a message concurrently, the newest wins; writers may delete
older ones.

## The document

UTF-8 JSON. Keep it under about 1 MB; a reader may refuse a document that is
much larger than that (Android stops at 4 MB), since anyone can drop a file
with that name into Saved Messages.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `format` | Always `tellurgram-folders`. |
| `version` | Format version; a bump means an incompatible change. Readers ignore documents with a version they do not know. Unknown keys are ignored, which is why an optional key added later leaves the version alone: a client that does not know it keeps reading the document, and only drops that key when it writes one of its own. |
| `updated` | Unix seconds of the last write. Readers apply the document only when it is newer than the last `updated` they applied (last writer wins, whole document, no merge). Writers set it to `max(now, previous.updated + 1)`. |
| `folders` | Folder list; array order is the order of the Mercurygram folders relative to each other. Their position among server folders is per device. |
| `id` | Integer **<= -2**, stable across devices. The namespace is disjoint from server folder ids (0 and >= 2), and -1 is reserved: both clients use it as a "no folder" placeholder in their UI code, so writers never assign it and readers refuse a document that carries it. Pick the id **at random** over the negative range rather than counting down: a writer only knows its own folders, so two devices that each create a folder before they sync would otherwise both pick the same first value and the reader would merge the two into one. Not reused after a delete within one document. |
| `title` | Plain text, the `text` of `dialogFilter.title`. |
| `title_entities` | Optional. The custom emojis in the title, as `{"offset", "length", "document_id"}`; offsets and lengths are UTF-16 units, as in MTProto and in a Java String. `document_id` is a **decimal string**, not a number: a JSON number is a double in some readers, which would round an id past 2^53 into a different emoji. An entity that does not fit the title is dropped by the reader, the rest of the document stands. No other entity type is written, and a reader ignores the ones it finds. |
| `title_noanimate` | Optional, false when missing. `dialogFilter.title_noanimate`: the custom emojis in the title do not animate. |
| `emoticon` | Optional. `dialogFilter.emoticon`, the folder icon, one emoji. Absent or empty for the default icon, which each client derives from the folder itself. The Android client has no icon of its own: it keeps what it read and writes it back unchanged, so a folder that got its icon on Desktop keeps it. |
| `color` | `-1` for none, otherwise the folder-tag colour index as in `dialogFilter.color`. |
| `flags` | The `dialogFilter` TL flag names with the same meaning, so a reader can build a native `DialogFilter` and reuse its own membership logic. Missing flags are false. The shared-folder fields have no place here and a reader must not invent them: a Mercurygram folder has no copy on the server, so nothing can hang an invite link on it (`dialogFilterChatlist`, `has_my_invites`, and the `Chatlist` / `HasMyLinks` flags the clients keep for a shared folder). |
| `include`, `exclude`, `pinned` | **Bot API marked peer ids**: user `id`, basic group `-id`, channel or supergroup `-1000000000000 - id`. Identical to Telethon's `utils.get_peer_id`, not to Android's `dialogId`, which is `-id` for a channel too. Secret chats never appear. `pinned` is ordered (first pinned first) and a subset of `include`. |

## Reading it from a bot (Telethon)

```python
msgs = await client.get_messages("me", search="#tellurgram_folders",
                                 filter=types.InputMessagesFilterDocument, limit=5)
msgs = [m for m in msgs if m.file and m.file.name == "tellurgram-folders.json"]
if msgs:
    raw = await client.download_media(max(msgs, key=lambda m: m.id), bytes)
    doc = json.loads(raw)
```

Each folder maps onto `types.DialogFilter(id=..., title=TextWithEntities(text=title, entities=[...]),
include_peers=[...], exclude_peers=[...], pinned_peers=[...], contacts=..., ...)`, with peers
built through `utils.resolve_id(marked)` and a zero `access_hash` (only
`utils.get_peer_id()` is ever needed on them for matching).
